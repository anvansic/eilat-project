Project Details, Requirements and Remarks

Requirements
1.) Create a single-page application containing a full-screen map using the Google Maps API.

2.) Display at least 5 interesting locations by default in the neighborhood map that is loaded.

3.) Create a list of those locations (for example, in a column on the left.

4.) Create a filter - a text input or dropdown menu - that filters the list and the markers in real time.

5.) Use 3rd party APIs (i.e. NOT Google) asynchronously to provide information for selected map markers or list items.

6.) Add animation to map markers that runs when the map marker or its associated list item is selected.

7.) Add infoWindows that display information retrieved from the 3rd party APIs when their corresponding markers or list items are clicked.

8.) Make the interface intuitive and easy to use.

Remarks
*This application must be implemented using the KnockoutJS framework.
NOTE: Click events should be handled with Knockout.
NOTE: You can create markers as part of the ViewModel, but they must not be implemented as observables.

*APIs must be loaded asynchronously, and appropriate error-handling must be in place.

*The design must be responsive for effective use on all devices.
